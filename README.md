# Flappy Creep 

Flappy Creep is a Flappy Bird game in which the player controls a bird that keeps moving to the right. The player's task is to navigate the bird avoiding the appearing pipes at the top and bottom of the screen. The gaps between the pipes are placed at random heights. The bird descends and rises. Each successful passage inside a pair of pipes awards the player a certain number of points. A collision with a pipe or ground ends the game.
